      <description>Welcome to electronics 101: My First Circuit. I had to write this post because I have brain glitches and sometimes forget how a breadboard works&amp;hellip;
When you learn to code, the first thing you learn is how to output the string Hello World!. Allow me to introduce the electronics equivalent of the hello world: a circuit which lights up a LED.
For this circuit, you&amp;rsquo;ll need:
 a breadboard a power source a LED a resistor jumper wires  I recommend getting a &amp;ldquo;electronics starter kit&amp;rdquo;, they should all have these basic components.</description>

      <description>Description  Can you jump your way to win in the following program and get the flag? You can find the program in /problems/leap-frog_4_32907c7b6e253bd5d9422083e7243619 on the shell server? Source.
  Try and call the functions in the correct order! Remember, you can always call main() again!  Solution Let&amp;rsquo;s first have a look at the source code:
#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;#include &amp;lt;stdlib.h&amp;gt;#include &amp;lt;string.h&amp;gt;#include &amp;lt;unistd.h&amp;gt;#include &amp;lt;sys/types.h&amp;gt;#include &amp;lt;stdbool.h&amp;gt; #define FLAG_SIZE 64  bool win1 = false; bool win2 = false; bool win3 = false; void leapA() { win1 = true; } void leap2(unsigned int arg_check) { if (win3 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; arg_check == 0xDEADBEEF) { win2 = true; } else if (win3) { printf(&amp;#34;Wrong Argument.</description>

      <description>Description  Can you exploit the following program to get a flag? You can find the program in /problems/rop32_0_b4142d4df31cb73e170c77dac234a79a on the shell server. Source.
 Hint: This is a classic ROP to get a shell
Solution Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the source code:
#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;#include &amp;lt;stdlib.h&amp;gt;#include &amp;lt;string.h&amp;gt;#include &amp;lt;unistd.h&amp;gt;#include &amp;lt;sys/types.h&amp;gt; #define BUFSIZE 16  void vuln() { char buf[16]; printf(&amp;#34;Can you ROP your way out of this?\n&amp;#34;); return gets(buf); } int main(int argc, char **argv){ setvbuf(stdout, NULL, _IONBF, 0); // Set the gid to the effective gid  // this prevents /bin/sh from dropping the privileges  gid_t gid = getegid(); setresgid(gid, gid, gid); vuln(); } The vulnerability here is due to the usage of the gets() function.</description>

      <description>Kioptrix level 2, here we go! Follow along by grabbing the VM on https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/kioptrix-level-11-2,23/. Make sure to download the level 2 - updated version as the first release had a bug in the web application.
The goal is the same than the previous one: get root by any possible mean.
Fixing the network As the previous Kioptrix, the network wasn&amp;rsquo;t working out of the box for me.

      <description>First post in the pentest category, we take a trip through time and try to break into one of the oldest box to root: Kioptrix.
Trying to break these box with a kali 2020 is a bit of a challenge as most of the stuff is ancient and has been dropped from all modern distributions, including kali. Expect lots of fixing :D

      <description>Description  Use a format string to pwn this program and get a flag. Its also found in /problems/stringzz_6_5f0e31bfd7b9a7c6a32d22b6d57e9010 on the shell server. Source.
 Hint: http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/Teaching/cis643/LectureNotes_New/Format_String.pdf
Solution Let&amp;rsquo;s check the source code first:
#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;#include &amp;lt;stdlib.h&amp;gt;#include &amp;lt;string.h&amp;gt; #define FLAG_BUFFER 128 #define LINE_BUFFER_SIZE 2000  void printMessage3(char *in) { puts(&amp;#34;will be printed:\n&amp;#34;); printf(in); } void printMessage2(char *in) { puts(&amp;#34;your input &amp;#34;); printMessage3(in); } void printMessage1(char *in) { puts(&amp;#34;Now &amp;#34;); printMessage2(in); } int main (int argc, char **argv) { puts(&amp;#34;input whatever string you want; then it will be printed back:\n&amp;#34;); int read; unsigned int len; char *input = NULL; getline(&amp;amp;input, &amp;amp;len, stdin); //There is no win function, but the flag is wandering in the memory!</description>

      <description>Description  Well it seems someone can&amp;rsquo;t keep their work life and their home life separate. You vaguely recall on your home planet, posters put up everywhere that said &amp;ldquo;Loose Zips sink large commercial properties with a responsibility to the shareholders.&amp;rdquo; You wonder if there is a similar concept here.
Using the credentials to access this so-called Agricultural network, you realize that SarahH was just hired as a vendor or contract worker and given access that was equivalent.</description>

      <description>Description  With the confidence of conviction and decision making skills that made you a contender for Xenon&amp;rsquo;s Universal takeover council, now disbanded, you forge ahead to the work computer. This machine announces itself to you, surprisingly with a detailed description of all its hardware and peripherals. Your first thought is &amp;ldquo;Why does the display stand need to announce its price? And exactly how much does 999 dollars convert to in Xenonivian Bucklets?</description>

      <description>Description  Blunderbussing your way through the decision making process, you figure that one is as good as the other and that further research into the importance of Work Life balance is of little interest to you. You&amp;rsquo;re the decider after all. You confidently use the credentials to access the &amp;ldquo;Home Computer.&amp;rdquo; Something called &amp;ldquo;desktop&amp;rdquo; presents itself, displaying a fascinating round and bumpy creature (much like yourself) labeled &amp;ldquo;cauliflower 4 work - GAN post.</description>

      <description>I picked the binary of the challenge satellite from Google CTF beginner&amp;rsquo;s quest 2019 as a first target to learn go reversing.
Description  Placing your ship in range of the Osmiums, you begin to receive signals. Hoping that you are not detected, because it&amp;rsquo;s too late now, you figure that it may be worth finding out what these signals mean and what information might be &amp;ldquo;borrowed&amp;rdquo; from them. Can you hear me Captain Tim?</description>

      <description>Description  Ok well done. The console is on. It&amp;rsquo;s asking for coordinates. Beating heavily on the console yields little results, but the only time anything changes on your display is when you put in numbers.. So what numbers are you going to go for? You see the starship&amp;rsquo;s logs, but is there a manual? Or should you just keep beating the console?
 Solving Here we go!

      <description>There are tons of tutorial telling you how to debug with gdb and IDA Windows, but what about IDA Linux eh?
How does debugging work? IDALinux doesn&amp;rsquo;t have real local debugging :(( A debug server stub is used to relay information between IDA and the debugger.
And Breakpoints?
Breakpoints are implemented using software interrupts or traps:
More precisely, they are implemented by the trap int 3, ie trap to debugger.</description>

      <description>Have you ever tried to disassemble only one function with objdump?
Let&amp;rsquo;s take a tiny code which prints the result of an addition function:
#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;#include &amp;lt;stdint.h&amp;gt; uint32_t add(uint32_t a, uint32_t b) { return a + b; } int main(int argc, char* argv[]) { uint32_t result = add(1300, 37); printf(&amp;#34;result is %i\n&amp;#34;, result); return 0; } Compile it and run it:
$ gcc add.c -g -o add $ ./add result is 1337 Let&amp;rsquo;s now try to dump only one specific function, for example, add.</description>

      <description>The goal of this mini-project is to create and simulate a full project for Lattice Diamond, from start to end.
As a test subject, we will use the AND gate. We will create our own frankANDstein gate and give it liiiiiife.
Installation /!\ I didn&amp;rsquo;t read the fine prints before installing, but short story, the simulator Active HDL is not included on the Linux version of Lattice Diamond. So find yourself a Windows box :(.</description>

Standard attacks:
 ltrace: library calls tracing strace: syscalls tracing strings (lol) fenris ==&amp;gt; never heard of that one, execution path tracing gdb: application debugging /proc: memory dumping  Defense:
 encrypting the binary will scramble the strings ltrace, strace, fenris and gdb are all based on the ptrace API ==&amp;gt; disabling that API would be a huge step /proc:  only portions of the binary are decrypted at any given time can&amp;rsquo;t dump fully decrypted image via /proc filesystem   apart from static analysis, the vast majority of attacks against the binary can be detected and prevented  layers: like an onion, each layer of encryption makes it harder for the attacker because he has to defeat one layer after the other</description>
