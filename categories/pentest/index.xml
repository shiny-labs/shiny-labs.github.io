      <description>Kioptrix level 2, here we go! Follow along by grabbing the VM on https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/kioptrix-level-11-2,23/. Make sure to download the level 2 - updated version as the first release had a bug in the web application.
The goal is the same than the previous one: get root by any possible mean.
Fixing the network As the previous Kioptrix, the network wasn&amp;rsquo;t working out of the box for me.

      <description>First post in the pentest category, we take a trip through time and try to break into one of the oldest box to root: Kioptrix.
Trying to break these box with a kali 2020 is a bit of a challenge as most of the stuff is ancient and has been dropped from all modern distributions, including kali. Expect lots of fixing :D
Fixing the network of Kioptrix After importing the Kioptrix VM to VMware, I had troubles changing the network adapter from bridge to NAT.</description>
